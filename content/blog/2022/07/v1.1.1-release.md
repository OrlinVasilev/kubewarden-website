We are happy to announce the first minor release of v1.0: **v1.1.1** is
now available!

Apart from being a nice looking number, **v1.1.1** includes:

* Improved the policies API for Sigstore verification by adding new
  backwards-compatible WaPC host callback `v2/verify` functions to the API.
  [Check them out
    here](https://docs.kubewarden.io/writing-policies/spec/host-capabilities/signature-verifier-policies)
  to add support for your language of choice.

  This has been used in the verify-image-signatures policy to simplify
  verification of GitHub Actions signatures and others. Read about it in [this
  blog post](../verify-signatures-with-gha-and-prefix/).
  
* Made `policy-server` and `kwctl` resilient to hiccups in the upstream
  Sigstore's repository for Fulcio and Rekor by making it optional. With this change,
  Kubewarden tools will proceed forward, informing the user, and continue to
  fail safely by issuing false negatives of signature verifications if needed.

  This overcomes last weeks' metadata update in the upstream Sigstore repository,
  which sadly was non [TUF
  spec](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest) compliant.
  
  This is also part of the groundwork for making air-gapped installations easier
  to use.

Try it out!
It is just a `helm upgrade` away, and as usual, we look forward to your
feedback :).
