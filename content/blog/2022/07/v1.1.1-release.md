We are happy to announce that the first minor release of v1.0: **v1.1.1** is
out!

Apart from being a nice looking number, **v1.1.1** includes:

* Improved the policies API for Sigstore verification, and added new
  backwards-compatible WaPC host callback `v2/verify` functions to the API. You
[Check them out
  here](https://docs.kubewarden.io/writing-policies/spec/host-capabilities/signature-verifier-policies)
to add support for your language of choice.
  
This has been used in the verify-image-signatures policy to simplify
  verification of GitHub Actions signatures, and others. Read about it in [this
  blog post](../verify-signatures-with-gha-and-prefix/).
* Made Kubewarden resilient to hiccups in the upstream Sigstore's repository for
  Fulcio and Rekor. Last week, there was a metadata update in the upstream
  Sigstore repository, which sadly was non [TUF
  spec](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest) compliant.

  Apart from collaborating with upstream to get it fixed, we have improved its
  handling in `policy-server` & `kwctl` v1.1.1; now they will proceed forward,
  informing the user, and continue to fail safely by issuing false negatives if
  needed.
  
  This is also part of the groundwork for making air-gapped
  installations easier to use.

Try it out!
It is just a `helm upgrade` away, and as usual, we look forward to your
feedback :).
