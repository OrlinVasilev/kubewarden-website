Today the whole Kubewarden team is overjoyed because the
Kubewarden project has just been accepted into the
[CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/)!!! ðŸ¥³

This is a great achievement for the whole team and is the beginning of
our journey into CNCF.
Also, many thanks to the CNCF TOC for the feedback they provided during the
project evaluation.

## What's next?

The admission happens at an interesting time since we are currently testing
the `1.0.0-rc1` release of Kubewarden.

Yes, you got it right! We were working on the `1.0.0` release of Kubewarden
when the announcement was made.
The CNCF sandbox admission is going to be the cherry on the top of
the `1.0.0` project milestone ðŸ˜ƒ

Stay tuned for more news!
